Regex Components

Anchors
The $ anchor signifies a string that ends with the characters that precede it. Just as with the ^ character, it can be preceded by an exact string or a range of possible matches.

Quantifiers
Quantifiers set the limits of the string that your regex matches (or an individual section of the string). They frequently include the minimum and maximum number of characters that your regex is looking for.
